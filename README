This is a sample framework for developing test applications in linux. 
The Intel C/CPP Compiler is used for building test code.
The directory structure is as follows:

Prior to building there are only two subdirectories present:
1. src
2. inc

All the source files are expected to be saved at src/, and all the header
files to be saved at inc/

Post building, two new folders are created:
3. obj
4. bin

All the intermediary object files are expected to be saved in the obj/ directory
, while the final binary/executable is expected to be located at the bin/ 
directory. These two folders will be destroyed upon running 'make clean'.

Currently the makefile supports only C files, but can easily be modified to CPP by changing the search for source files from *.c to *.cpp
